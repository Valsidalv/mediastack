Mediastack news application

This is Anngular app for displaying news from Mediastack API. When you download it, just install neccessary dependancies using npm install and then run it with ng serve. I will assume you have Angular installed. :) It displays news, allows you to filter them by 2 cathegories or by typing in search field the desired title. Also, you can order them by date from old to new and vise versa.
